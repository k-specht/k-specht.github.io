# Gamedev Portfolio
I'm an Indie Game Developer, which means I do a little bit of everything.
Everything here is from my WIP game, Mutate (inspired by [Amorphous+](<https://www.kongregate.com/games/innocuousgames/amorphous>)).
It's made in the [Bevy Game Engine](<https://bevyengine.org/>), which means all of it is coded in Rust as a plugin (Bevy has no editor!).

## Game Logic
Some game engines will have built-in logic for entities, physics, and even effects.
If it doesn't, or more complex logic is needed, this is my forte!

## 3D Modeling
My specialty isn't 3D-modeling, but sometimes a game needs a small animated object *fast*.
All of the models and animations showcased here are content I made using Blender.

## Effect Programming
Some effects are very specific or resource-heavy, and need a well-optimized implementation.
I made this [Marching Squares](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares>) implementation for my mobile game for this reason!
With the right shaders, these can look even better on other platforms.

## Physics Baking
Sometimes a game needs a "real-looking" animation that just can't be made with armature deforms, like a death animation or a dripping pipe.

## Level Design
Open-source tools can make 3D dungeons easy!
This is a tilemap to 3D converting tool I made that makes use of a [Bevy tilemap editor](<https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap>).

## Mod Support
Modding communities can be a huge boon of popularity for a game.
Making mod-friendly code isn't easy, but it can also make later updates to the game much faster.
